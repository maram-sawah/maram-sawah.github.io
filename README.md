#Hello ,I'm Maram Emad El-sawah

##About me
I'm an enthusiastic and detail-oriented **Aspiring Data & AI Engineer** with a solid foundation in Python, data manipulation, and machine learning principles. My journey into the world of data began during my university studies, and I've been actively building my skills ever since through hands-on projects.

While I may be at the beginning of my professional career, what I lack in years of experience, I make up for with a **strong passion for learning, a problem-solving mindset, and a commitment to writing clean, efficient code.** I've successfully completed projects involving data cleaning, analysis, and building predictive models, and I'm eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.

I am actively seeking entry-level opportunities or internships where I can learn from experienced professionals and add value to your team. Let's connect!

I help businesses transform raw data into actionable insights using Python and cloud technologies.

##Project 1: Sales Data Analysis & Insights Dashboard

- **The Problem:** A business has messy sales data stored in multiple CSV files. They need a clear way to understand their performance, track trends, and identify their best-selling products to make better decisions.

- **The Solution:** I built a complete data analysis pipeline using Python. I started by cleaning and merging the messy data from different sources using **Pandas**. Then, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find key insights. Finally, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize the results, making it easy for non-technical users to understand the story behind the numbers.

- **The Outcome:** The project provided the business with actionable insights, such as:
  - Identifying the top 10 best-selling products.
  - Analyzing sales trends over time to see peak seasons.
  - Calculating total revenue and profit margins.
  - The dashboard allowed the business to make data-driven decisions that could potentially increase sales efficiency.

- **Technologies Used:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Jupyter Notebook`

### Project 2: Egyptian Real Estate Price Analysis (Web Scraping + EDA)

- **The Problem:** It's difficult for potential buyers or investors to get a clear, data-driven overview of apartment prices and trends in different neighborhoods in Cairo from online listings.

- **The Solution:** I built a web scraper using **Python** and the **BeautifulSoup** library to automatically collect data from a major Egyptian real estate website (e.g., AqarMap or OLX Properties). The scraper extracted key information like:
  - Apartment price
  - Location (City, District)
  - Area (size in meters)
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Listing date

  I then stored this cleaned data in a structured format (CSV file) and used **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to analyze it and create visualizations.

- **The Outcome:** The analysis revealed fascinating insights, such as:
  - The average price per square meter in different areas of Cairo (e.g., Nasr City vs. New Cairo).
  - The correlation between the number of bedrooms and the price.
  - How prices have fluctuated over recent months based on listing dates.
  - This project demonstrates the ability to collect data from the web and turn it into actionable market intelligence.

- **Technologies Used:** `Python`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib/Seaborn`
